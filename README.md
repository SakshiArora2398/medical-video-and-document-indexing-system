# video-and-document-indexing <br />

Cloud Computing and Big Data Project <br />

We built a video and document indexing system using AWS components like Cognito, Lambdas, API Gateway, SQS, AWS Transcribe, AWS Textract, and Comprehend to develop 
functionalities such as allowing secure login and signup, upload videos and image/document files, and look up images/documents and using high confidence keywords.
